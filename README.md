# bowlingfan's website
first main website for bowlingfan21317-created with pure CSS and HTML and hosted on **neocities.** started may 17th, 2025 and finished may 20th, 2925. i learnt a lot of the web designing stuff again from W3Schools and a _ton of research..._ and i mean _way too much research._ no javascript was ever used to make this website.

link to website: https://extremities.neocities.org/

it is a little finnicky on some smaller mobile devices, especially those with a lower width than 250 pixels. i used some absolute positioning which i think may be the cause to most of my issues. <br /><br />
cool stuff used:
* media queries (for mobile friendliness)
* CSS transitions/animations & keyframes (for the animations in the website)

## notes
the messages page is a place for blogging; **no new posts will be added after May 20th, 2025** as all blog posts use the same CSS file: ```src/css files/post_style.css```. if an overhaul of the website occurs, only the posts prior to May 20th, 2025 will be updated and shown on github.

## credits
* W3Schools for teaching me to program in HTML/CSS and some extra techniques.
* neocities for hosting the website for _free_
* stack overflow for answering all my questions..
* friends for motivating me to do this.
