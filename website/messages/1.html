          i don't know what happeend.. i decided on a random night to head back into monkeytype and test my 15 second typing speed, but something odd was happening.. i don't know how, whether i've been lucky to stroll among easy texts, but i destroyed my original pb of 182 wpm <b>TWICE</b> with one being 185 wpm, and the other being 196 wpm. which is insane to me.. i've been seeking to try to reach that 200 wpm and i literally can't imagine that casual tryharding would somehow make me nearly reach that speed that i've been so curious to experience for years.
          <br><br>
          i've been trying to increase my typing speed since 2021 but i don't do really any proper practice anymore, i just kind of type for the fun of it when it comes time. the last activity i've done was going on nitrotype and mass typing on a team until i found out they have macros and quit. i can't believe this ya'll, i guess i am 1 step closer to reaching 200 wpm.
