          finally happy to silently announce that my website's open after updating it a ton of times.. working with html and css for a few days was fun but also a pain to handle lol especially trying to make it "somewhat" mobile friendly. animations were surprisingly easy to put in and i enjoyed that the most! (transitions/css animations, i did not use any javascript to make this website.)

          i'm happy i can at least introduce myself a bit properly i guess and maybe you'll get to learn something about me that might interest you. in fact, i have a blog i guess so now i can actually random talk about things if i feel like it or just provide updates about myself.

          i think it's time to finally go back to learning C++ though, it was cool doing web designing again after being traumitized from competition 3 years ago xD
