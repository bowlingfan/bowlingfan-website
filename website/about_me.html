            i really like to go bowling, play some games, dream too much, and try to be a friend. i also listen to any music as long as it sounds good. <br><br>
            i am kind of getting into minimalism and trying to "improve" myself; basically want to live simply. <br><br>
            i also program, attempting to expand my skills in C++ and make software. <br><br>
            i guess i am a nerd... i get involved in some things from time to time.

            <i>sometimes</i> i'm in pieces; like shattered colored glass.<br><br>
            i consider myself massively boring and bland. <br><br>
            i'm often stuck in 2017, not really caught up with the "modern" world. <br><br>
            i'm pretty antisocial... yet i somehow find a way to poke people online and make meaningless conversations.<br><br>
